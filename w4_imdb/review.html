            <!-- <p> review for below -->
            <p><em>Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</em> is my faviorte of movie of all time, and what I consider to be the Star Wars movie. I think what makes it the best is Lukes story how he is learning to control something new to him, but makes the decision to go help his friends and face his fears head on.</p>

                <h3><em>Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</em> Trivia</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mark Hamill had to bang his head sixteen times on the ceiling of Yoda's hut before director Irvin Kershner was satisfied with the scene.</li>
                    <li>David Prowse was unaware that Darth Vader was Luke's father until he saw this movie, and was quite upset with George Lucas afterward, saying his physical acting would have been completely different if he'd known the real line.</li>
                    <li>The telepathic communication between Luke and Leia at the end (when Luke pleads for his rescue from the Cloud City) is the only hint that Luke and Leia share a special bond, something that is finally revealed in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983).</li>
                </ul>
