I'm <i>Garrett</i>, but you probably already knew that because I had your python class. I love music and my faviorte band is <u>Pink Floyd</u>. I really enjoy their album "Wish You Were Here", but I would have to say that my favorite song is "Echoes" off of their album "Meddle". I wish I was able to see them preform but they stopped doing shows after one of the members passed away :(.</p>
